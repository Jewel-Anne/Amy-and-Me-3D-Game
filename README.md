# Amy-and-Me-3D-Game
"Amy and Me" is a 3D chase game project developed for an Introduction to Artificial Intelligence Course (COSC 30073). In this game, the player competes against an AI opponent named Amy to keep the ball away from her for 3 minutes. The game utilizes A* and Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithms to create challenging and dynamic gameplay.

To play the game, run the "Amy and Me.exe"

## Gameplay:
1. The game starts with the item (ball) on the floor.
2. The players must use their movement controls (A,W,S,D) to navigate through the house and avoid
obstacles while keeping possession of the item.
3. The opposing player who doesnâ€™t have the item will try to catch up with the player and
retrieve the item by chasing them through the house. The player must use their
strategic and tactical skills to outmaneuver the AI (Amy) and stay ahead of them.
4. If the player loses possession of the item, they can try to retrieve it by chasing Amy and using the pick control (E).
5. The player can use the environment to their advantage, such as using obstacles to slow
down Amy's path.
6. The game ends after the 3-minute time limit, and the player who has possession of the
item at the end of the game wins. If the AI has possession of the item at the end of the
game, the player loses.
